We were delighted to host Dr. Catherine A. Schevon from Columbia University for a visit to our lab. Dr. Schevon is a distinguished expert in epilepsy and neurophysiology, and it was a pleasure to share our recent progress and engage in scientific exchange.  

During her visit, our team presented ongoing research on transparent electrodes and new insights into the mechanisms of epileptic seizures. Dr. Schevon also toured our laboratory and had the opportunity to meet with team members to discuss current projects and experimental setups.  

We concluded the visit with a group dinner, where we continued our conversations in a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere. It was a wonderful opportunity for academic exchange and community building.  

We sincerely thank Dr. Schevon for her visit and valuable feedback, and we look forward to continued interactions in the future!
