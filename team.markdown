| **The Principal Investigator**  <br><br>  <img src="/jpgs/LJY.jpg" width="300">  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Dr. Jyun-you Liou, MD/PhD, Principal Investigator, Clinical Pediatric Anesthesiologist <br> Email: jyl9010@med.cornell.edu <br><br> Dr. Jyun-you Liou is dedicated to unraveling the complexities of neural activity under different anesthetic states. His groundbreaking work combines advanced imaging techniques with computational modeling to advance our understanding of the brain during anesthesia. <br><br> Dr. Liou is originally from Taiwan. He received his medical degree from National Taiwan University and completed his pediatric residency at National Taiwan University Children’s Hospital. Dr. Liou then moved to the US and earned his doctorate in neurophysiology from Columbia University. He then completed his anesthesiology residency at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and his pediatric anesthesiology fellowship at the University of Washington/Seattle Children’s Hospital.  |  
 | **Computational Scientist**  <br><br>  <img src="/jpgs/qiz2sf.jpg" width="300">   | Dr. Qianwei Zhou, PhD, Computational Analyst <br> Email: qiz4008@med.cornell.edu  <br><br> Qianwei Zhou is a Postdoc Fellow in WCM. He received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from the Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, University of Chinese Academic and Sciences, Shanghai, China, in 2014. <br><br> In July 2014, he joined Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China, where he was an Associate Professor in the College of Computer Science and Technology. And he was also a visiting scholar in Imaging Research Division, Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, USA, during 08/2018-08/2019. He has published scientific papers in international journals and conference proceedings, including the Nature Communications, IEEE Tranactions on Industrial Electronics, IEEE Signal Processing Letters and IEEE Transactions on Magnetics. His research interests include the crossing field of machine learning and computer-aided design, Internet-of-Thing-related signal processing, pattern recognition and medical image understanding.    |  
 | **Chief Scientist and Photographer**  <br><br>  <img src="/jpgs/adi2.jpg" width="300">  | Aditya Iyer, BS, Research Technician <br> Email: adi4001@med.cornell.edu <br><br> Aditya Iyer serves as the Research Technician in our lab, specializing as a surgeon and experimentalist, while also overseeing the management of our animal colonies. He graduated from Stony Brook University, where he receieved a BS in Biochemistry. His primary area of study here is E and I-neuron expression under two-photon microscopy with concurrent electrophysiology under various states of anesthesia under Dr. Liou.  |  
 | **The Visiting Neurosurgeon**  <br><br>  <img src="/jpgs/wzj3-1.jpg" width="300">  | Dr. Zhuojin Wu, MD, Neurosurgeon <br> Email: zhw4013@med.cornell.edu  <br><br> Zhuojin Wu is a Visiting Fellow in WCM. He received both his Ph.D and bachelor’s degree from Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Then he began his postdoctoral research in the Department of Neurosurgery at Tongji Hospital. His primary research interests focus on epilepsy, with particular emphasis on understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis and developing innovative treatment approaches. Dr. Wu's work integrates basic science research with clinical applications in neurosurgery, aiming to advance the management and therapeutic outcomes for patients with seizure disorders.   |  
 | **The Visiting Neurosurgeon 2023~2025**  <br><br>  <img src="/jpgs/wsq3.jpg" width="300">  | Dr. Shiqiang Wu, MD, Neurosurgeon <br> Email: shw4016@med.cornell.edu  <br><br> Shiqiang Wu is a Visiting Fellow in WCM. Dr. Wu received both his MD and bachelor's degree from Hua Zhong University of Science and Technology. He is an attending neurosurgeon in Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College at Hua Zhong University of Science and Technology. His basic scientific research focuses on using custom-built widefield imaging systems, two-photon methods and ECOG to understand the roles of different cell types in epilepsy and anesthetic state. Clinically, he primarily focuses on the preoperative evaluation and surgery for patients with epilepsy.  |
