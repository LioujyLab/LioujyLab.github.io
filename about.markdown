# About Us

The Liou lab is interested in the mechanisms of anesthetic-induced brain activity to search for novel applications of anesthetics in diagnosing and managing neuropsychiatric disorders. Our approach includes electrophysiological, optical, and computational modeling approaches. The lab uses transgenic mice as the main model organism, approached by widefield calcium imaging, multiphoton microscopy, and in vivo extracellular electrophysiology. Meanwhile, we are part of an extensive human intracranial EEG collaboration network. Currently, our lab has the following two major research directions.

1. Anesthesia, Consciousness, and Sleep: Exploring Brain States

How do general anesthesia and natural sleep resemble and differ from one another? Both states are characterized by significant shifts in brain activity, including slow waves—patterns of synchronized activity across neurons that dominate during deep sleep and some stages of anesthesia. Slow waves play a crucial role in recalibrating brain activity and maintaining a balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals (E/I balance) necessary for healthy brain function.

In this research direction, we address questions such as:


I.  How do the firing patterns of cortical neurons during anesthetic-induced slow waves compare to those during natural sleep?

II.  What role do these waves play in restoring brain network stability and functionality?

III.  Can anesthetics be tailored to help sleep disorders or aid in recovery from sleep disturbances caused by medical conditions?

We delve into the electrophysiological signatures of these brain states, leveraging cutting-edge imaging and recording techniques to uncover how brain activity evolves. This research deepens our understanding of anesthesia and sleep and has potential implications for improving therapies targeting neuropsychiatric conditions linked to sleep and consciousness.

2. Epilepsy and Neural Network Dynamics: Understanding and Intervening

Epilepsy offers a unique lens through which to study how neural networks change and adapt—or fail to adapt—over time. Building on inherited projects and longstanding collaborations, our lab investigates the progression of neocortical network activity during epileptogenesis, the process by which a brain becomes susceptible to recurring seizures.

Some of the key questions we aim to answer include:

I. How do neocortical neural activity patterns, connectivity, and information processing evolve during the onset of epilepsy?

II. What mechanisms contribute to the transition from normal brain function to a state of chronic seizures?

We use kindling models to induce and study neocortical epileptic activity in animal brains. Kindling allows us to gradually increase the brain's susceptibility to seizures, providing a controlled way to examine changes in network dynamics. Our work includes testing innovative therapeutic approaches, including pharmacological interventions and electrophysiological techniques, to halt or reverse the progression of epilepsy.

By integrating our studies of brain states and network dynamics, the Liou Lab seeks to contribute to understanding brain function and dysfunction. Through our research, we aim to open new avenues for treating complex neurological and psychiatric conditions, from sleep disorders to epilepsy.

Our lab benefits from a rich network of collaborations, which enhances our access to cutting-edge research tools and innovative ideas. Our active collaborators include (alphabetical order):
