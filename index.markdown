## Key Research Areas

### Neural Traces Under Anesthesia
We investigate how neural circuits are altered during anesthesia using state-of-the-art imaging technologies.

### Computational Modeling
Our lab develops models to simulate and analyze brain activity, bridging the gap between experimental data and theoretical understanding.
